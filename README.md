## The Idea
In my sprout days I have been crafting all available items and came up with my own spreadsheet for any materials I needed for crafting. The work of always checking for spreadsheet even in sorted and filtered format seemed tedious – I have all the data, just tell me where to go and what to do! So I came up with the idea of this simple app that will help to improve gathering experience.

## Contribution

I welcome all the contributions to ideas and/or accumulated data! As of November, 12 2022 there is present just one table: `materials.tsv`, which serves as entry point for application. With the help of the community I hope to get the full data for things that you just need to come at `(x, y)` and collect `n` items.

### General Idea
For now you can only contribute in one way: via **Issues**. You can go trough **Issues** to leave your own suggestions or reactions for other's contributions. My workflow will be built around **Issues** with some of them being prioritized over others (please leave your comments and reactions in an **Issues** you think should get more attention). I will add a way to contribute to data later, please use **Issues** for now.

### Issues

For **Issues**, there will be some strict division by labels such as _"Bug"_, _"Feature request"_, etc. Please open your **Issue** and describe what you want to change or improve! **Issues** with vague context ***will not*** be taken seriously, so please commit carefully. If you want to describe more than one feature request or report more than one bug etc. please open separate tickets (if you want to add new data, you can list more than one new rows or changes in one ticket). I will also add special label for feedback posts, because I do not know where I can store such valuable info that will be visible to community (if you know a good place for feedback, please report it as _"Feature request"_!).

#### How to Report New Issue
Please go to **Issues** tab and click **New issue**. Make a nice title for your report, describe your idea as thoroughly as possible. The **Issue** will be in _"Open"_ status. When I get to check new **Issues**, I will assign label to it. To make expirience more smooth, please state your intention in title or description. Some good ways to describe an **Issue**: 
> "[Bug] Something doesn't work right" title

or 

> "Here is a feature request" in Issue description. 

I look forward to your **Issues** to improve our quality of life with this app!

### Contributing to data
TODO

## Roadmap
The roadmap is written in another `.md` file! Here is a [link](ROADMAP.md). It is empty for now, but will be populated with steps based on community suggestions.
